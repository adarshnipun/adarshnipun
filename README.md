Hi I'm Adarsh. I am driven by how much data analysis, visualization, predictions etc have impacted lot of domains around us, taking them from absolutely no where to competing in a very active sense to make more insights.
My Journey towards this vast Data Science Universe taught me fundamentals I require to excel. I hope I will be a part of something big in this area one day.
